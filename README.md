## multi label classification

I’ll assume that you have Keras, scikit-learn, matpolotlib and OpenCV installed .

If this is your first deep learning rodeo, you have two options to ensure you have the proper libraries and packages ready to go:

Pre-configured environment (you’ll be up and running in less than 5 minutes and you can train today’s network for less money than a cup of Starbucks coffee)
Build your own environment (requires time, patience, and persistence)

I’m a fan of pre-configured environments in the cloud that you can spin up, upload files, train + grab your data, and then terminate in a matter of minutes. The two pre-configured environments I recommend are:

- Pre-configured Amazon AWS deep learning AMI with Python
- Microsoft’s data science virtual machine (DSVM) for deep learning
